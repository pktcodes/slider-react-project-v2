# Slider üéöÔ∏è

> PROD [Live] : https://react-slider-v2-prod.netlify.app/

#### Slider consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- **Slideshow** of the reviews mentioned by the people about their company.
- Each single review card has **image**, **name**, **title**, **quote**.
- Functionality of the **Autoplay** of the slides has been implemented every 2 seconds.
- Buttons that can be clicked i.e., ‚óÄÔ∏è for the previous slide and ‚ñ∂Ô∏è for the next slide. If the user reaches the last slide, one more click resets to the first slide and vice versa.
- Data is handled by the `data.js` and styles are handled by `index.css`
- Alternatively, for an easier approach, another slider has been also implemented using the **React Slick** library.
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.
